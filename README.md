## DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT REPORT
# Migration patterns between Argentina and Europe

# 1. Introduction
## 1.1. Project background
Migration has been a defining element in shaping societies globally, with historical movements significantly influencing contemporary patterns. Argentina, in particular, experienced a profound wave of European immigration during the 19th and early 20th centuries. This period, often referred to as the Great Immigration, saw millions of Europeans—primarily from Italy, Spain, and other European nations—migrate to Argentina. This influx was driven by factors such as economic hardship, political instability, and the promise of new opportunities in the Americas. The immigrants contributed substantially to Argentina’s cultural, social, and economic landscape, leaving a lasting legacy in the country's demographic composition and national identity.

In recent decades, a reverse migration trend has emerged, with increased flows of Argentinians moving to Europe, particularly Spain and Italy. This shift reflects a complex interplay of factors including economic challenges, political developments, and the evolving global context. As Argentina navigates economic difficulties and high poverty rates, the historical connection with European countries, once destinations for Argentine immigrants, now becomes a poignant aspect of contemporary migration dynamics. Understanding this reversal not only sheds light on current migration trends but also highlights the enduring links between Argentina and Europe, shaped by a shared historical narrative of migration.

In the current global context, understanding migration patterns is crucial for policymakers, researchers, and institutions. This project focuses on analyzing migration flows from Argentina to Europe, particularly to Spain and Italy, over the past 30 years. This period is selected to observe recent trends and compare them with historical migrations, reflecting on the historical and cultural connections between these countries.

## 1.2. Objectives

### General objectives

To analyze the relationship between poverty levels, employment, and other relevant indicators that may trigger migration from Argentina to Europe over the past 30 years, with a focus on Spain and Italy. These countries are chosen due to their historical, cultural, and ancestral connections with Argentina, stemming from significant European immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries.

### Specific objectives

- To evaluate how variations in GDP per capita among Argentina, Italy, and Spain influence migration patterns.
- To investigate the correlation between poverty rates in Argentina and migration trends towards Europe.
- To compare economic conditions in Argentina with those in Italy and Spain, focusing on key indicators such as GDP per capita and poverty levels.
- To assess migration exchanges between Argentina and Europe based on existing data.
- To analyze the demographic composition of migrants, including age, education level, and professional background, and how these factors impact migration decisions.

## 1.3. Research questions

- **How has the poverty rate in Argentina changed over the past 30 years, and how has this impacted migration flows to Italy and Spain?**

    Hypothesis: Increased poverty rates in Argentina are positively correlated with higher migration rates to Italy and Spain.

- **What differences exist in GDP per capita among Argentina, Italy, and Spain, and how do these differences relate to migration decisions?**

    **Hypothesis:** Lower GDP per capita in Argentina relative to Italy and Spain is associated with higher migration rates, as individuals seek better economic opportunities in countries with higher GDP per capita.

- **Is there a significant correlation between poverty in Argentina and migration to Europe?**

    **Hypothesis:** There is a significant correlation between higher poverty levels in Argentina and increased migration to Europe, with more severe poverty leading to higher migration rates.

- **What other economic factors (such as income inequality) might be influencing migration patterns?**

    **Hypothesis:** Besides poverty, high levels of income inequality in Argentina may also contribute to increased migration, as individuals from lower-income brackets seek more equitable opportunities in Europe.

- **What are the demographic characteristics of migrants from Argentina to Europe, and how do these characteristics influence migration trends?**

    **Hypothesis:** The demographic profile of migrants (including age, education, and occupation) affects migration trends, with younger, more educated individuals being more likely to migrate to Europe for better job prospects.

# 2. Methodology

## 2.1. Data sources and information

The sources listed below were selected for the analysis and were included and imported into the initial database: [dap1.0.sql](data\processed\dap1.0.sql).

### United Nations: Population Division

**International Migrant Stock**

Link: [International Migrant Stock](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/content/international-migrant-stock)

Description: This dataset includes processed graphs and original databases detailing immigration and emigration statistics for various countries. The dataset presents estimates of international migrants disaggregated by age, sex, and country of origin. These estimates are based on national statistics, primarily obtained from population censuses, population registers, and representative surveys. Data are available for the years 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020, covering 232 countries and areas worldwide.

**World Bank Group | Indicators and countries**

- **GDP per Capita (current US$)**

    Indicator ID: NY.GDP.PCAP.CD

    Link: [World Bank | GDP per Capita](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD)

    This indicator measures the total value of goods and services produced in a country divided by its population, expressed in current US dollars. It is commonly used to assess the standard of living and economic performance of a country. Comparing GDP per capita between Argentina, Italy, and Spain helps contextualize Argentina's economic standing relative to these European countries, offering insights into why migration trends might occur.

- **Net Migration**

    Indicator ID: SM.POP.NETM

    Link: [World Bank | Net Migration](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SM.POP.NETM)

    This indicator measures the net number of migrants (immigrants minus emigrants) in a country. It provides a direct view of migration trends and patterns.

- **Poverty Headcount Ratio at National Poverty Lines (% of Population)**

    Indicator ID: SI.POV.NAHC

    Link: [World Bank | Poverty Headcount Ratio](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.NAHC)

    This indicator measures the percentage of the population living below the national poverty line. It is a key measure for understanding local poverty conditions and is crucial for correlating poverty with migration trends. It provides a precise view of how many people are living under conditions deemed inadequate by national standards.

- **Unemployment, Total (% of Total Labor Force) (modeled ILO estimate)**

    Indicator ID: SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS

    Link: [World Bank | Unemployment Rate](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS?end=2023&start=1991&view=chart)

    This indicator represents the share of the labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking employment. It is used as an alternative measure in the absence of sufficient data for the poverty headcount ratio. Understanding unemployment rates helps provide additional context to migration trends and economic conditions.
